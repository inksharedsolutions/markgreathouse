                            Mark has played music ever since his father introduced him to the accordion at age five.  He won several awards for his accordion performances in Oregon before going to Europe during his college years to study German, where in the late 1960â€™s he met his future Czech wife Helena.  They were both foreign students at the University of Hamburg in Germany. The attraction was mutual, and when Helena discovered Mark could learn anything she could sing, he added his unique accompaniment to her music. As students in Germany they performed several months together in an international folklore cafe in Hamburg.  In 1970 they were married in the Historic Prague Old Town City Hall, and later that year they came to the United States, where they have lived ever since.  They frequently travel back to Europe to visit family and friends and perform their music.
