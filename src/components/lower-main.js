                            Mark and Helena Greathouse are a musical duo and live in Portland, Oregon.  Mark plays the accordion and Helena sings and dances.  They call themselves Greathouse of Music.  Markâ€™s introduction to music began at the age of five when his father, a music teacher in Portland, Oregon, introduced him to the accordion.  During his teenage years Mark won several awards for his accordion performances before going to Europe to study German, where he met his future wife, Helena, from Prague.
